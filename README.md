# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html). 

## Learning Goals

- Individualize your programming skill set

## Setup

- Fork this project to your own Github account
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- `cd` into the project

# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The web page offers a unique dish selection experience where users can choose a dish option and get a random dish from an extensive list of options for that category with a simple click of the "Let's Cook!" button. Once your dish name appears, the cookpot icon disappears, providing a clean and distraction-free interface to help you focus on your meal choice. A 'clear' button has also been added so the user can begin again.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Open the repo
2. Click the green Code button and copy the SSH
3. In Terminal, type the command 'mkdir' to create a new directory  and 'cd' into that directory
4. Once in the directory, type the command git clone [paste ssh]
5. Type the command 'code .' to open up VS Code
6. Type the command 'open index.html' to open in the browser.


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I had one week to work on the project. I am repeating Mod 1, and I didn't work much on the solo project the first time around, so this was all new. Every day I feel like I am learning more, and also that I I have so much more to learn. I worked approximately 15-20 hours on the project.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
Just me.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

1. Write clean, DRY JavaScript
2. Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
3. Apply understanding of the connections between HTML, CSS and JavaScript
4. Practice reading, understanding, and using flex box, event listeners, functions, and query selectors.
5. Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

I feel like I am competent enough to work in HTML and CSS now. 
I am doing better a bout communicating within the class about struggles
My understanding of the flow between query selectors, event listeners, and functions is much clearer.
